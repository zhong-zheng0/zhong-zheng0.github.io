I am a postdoctoral researcher in the [Department of Statistics and Data Science](https://statistics.wharton.upenn.edu/) at the Wharton School, University of Pennsylvania, advised by Dr. Dylan Small. I received my Ph.D. in Statistics from Penn State in 2025, where I was advised by Dr. Lingzhou Xue. I earned my Bachelor of Science in Statistics from Peking University in 2019, advised by Dr. Weinan E.

In 2026, I will join the University of Notre Dame as an Assistant Professor of Statistics.

My research focuses on developing new methods and theoretical frameworks to address key challenges in:
- Reinforcement learning  
- Online learning  
- Inventory management  
- Nonconvex optimization
- Causal Inference
